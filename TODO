QOL:
[] When user types a new input, scroll the right side to the very bottom to show input

Feature ideas:
[] Reusability - QOL
-allow users to store todos in categories such as 'daily todos' e.g. jog or read 15 mins (habit)
-things that need to be done everday anyway so no need to delete
-todos with this tag will not be cleared
-untoggle button to unclear (for reuse next day etc)

[] Stats tracking - catch
-sign in to save stats (track stats on weekly, monthly etc ERD)

[] Dynamic render of features - accessibility
-as users use features of the app, more things render (prevent TMI)
-e.g when they first start its just one box
-then once first TODO is input, render one todo
-once they click check on todo, render left side to clear or untoggle

[] Undo button on every delete - QOL
-using prev keyword? (research)

[] Motiv quote api - catch
