General TODO:

    [x] use todos to clear (useState)
[x] button to clear all completed tasks
    [x] check db in App
[x] style new nav buttons
[x] animation to indicate currently selected stopwatch input button
[x] fix span containing numbers. too wide

[x] fix issue not being able to set init stopwatch time - MVP
[x] fix stopwatch...
    [x] calc start time (when user presses start)

    [x] IF countdown -> e.g. user typed 20min (20 - time ealpsed) --> then format
[x] set time on todo

[x] add animation for button click feedback

[] total for completed tasks?
[x] total productive time
[] confirm delete feature
[] ability to edit each todo
[] reset stopwatch button (beside hourglass)



Bugs:
[x] stopwatch countdown - counts down into negative number
[x] typing space lots of times creates sillhouete (remove this. Only generate when text is inputted)
[x] remove ability to create empty todo titles
[] when multiple stopwatches are on, time only accounted for one.. flickers between 2 times (fix by only allowing 1 stopwatch to be used at a time?)
[] stopping and starting the stopwatch adds (3 mins? set amount of time) to the total minutes.. inaccurate total
[] unable to type in input field while stopwatch is running


QOL:
[] When user types a new input, scroll the right side to the very bottom to show input



Feature ideas:
[] Reusability - QOL
-allow users to store todos in categories such as 'daily todos' e.g. jog or read 15 mins (habit)
-things that need to be done everday anyway so no need to delete
-todos with this tag will not be cleared
-untoggle button to unclear (for reuse next day etc)

[] Stats tracking - catch
-sign in to save stats (track stats on weekly, monthly etc DB)

[x] Dynamic render of features - accessibility
-as users use features of the app, more things render (prevent TMI)
-e.g when they first start its just one box
-then once first TODO is input, render one todo
-once they click check on todo, render left side to clear or untoggle

[] Undo button on every delete - QOL
-using prev keyword? (research)

[] Motiv quote api - catch
